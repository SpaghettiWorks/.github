# 🏭 SpaghettiFactory

**Learning by breaking things.**

SpaghettiFactory is a collection of scripts, tools and experiments
built while learning automation, infrastructure, and homelab.

⚠️ Expect spaghetti.

### Why “spaghetti”?

Because every factory starts clean.  
Then you add conveyors.  
Then more conveyors.  
Then you realize it’s overengineered spaghetti.

At that point, breaking it and rebuilding
is part of the learning process.
